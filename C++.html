		<h1>C++</h1>
		<h2>What is C++?</h2>
		<p>• C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
		<p>• C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</p>
		<p>• C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
		<p>• The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</p>
		<h2>Why Use C++?</h2>
		<p>• C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</p>
		<p>• C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</p>
		<p>• C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</p>
		<p>• C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</p>
		<p>• As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.</p></font>
        <p class="test2">C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms. </p> 
		<p class="test2">C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>
		<p class="test2">The C++ language has an object-oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times. This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree.</p>
