		<h1>Programing Languages</h1>
		<p class="test2">•	A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
		<p class="test2">•	Many programming languages consist of the machine instructions. There are programmable machines that use a series of unique instructions instead of programming languages generally. The early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first being possibly the automatic flute player mentioned by the Musa brothers in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age in the 9th century. </p>
		<p class="test2">•	Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to guide the action of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.</p>
		<p class="test2">•	There are many types of programming languages like HTML,JAVA,C++ and PYTHON </p>
