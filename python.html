		<p class="test2">Python is a language of programming that is interpreted, of high level, of general use. Python's design philosophy, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, emphasizes the readability of code with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach are intended to help programmers write clear , logical code for small to large projects.</p>
		<p class="test2">Python is typed dynamically, and collected from garbage. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured programming (especially procedural), object-oriented, and functional. Because of its extensive standard library, Python is often described as "batteries included" language.</p>
		<p class="test2">Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. </p>
		<p class="test2">The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported. </p>
